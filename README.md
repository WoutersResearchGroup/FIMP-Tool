# FIMP Tool
Public repository of the prototype Python code related to research on an economic complexity based decision support tool for South African industrial policy masterplans. 

## Web-App
The developed Furniture Industry Masterplan Tool can be accessed as a web application on Streamlit from: [https://](https://fimp-tool.streamlit.app/)

The application features one Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and one Decision Support Indicator (DSI) for each key focus area (pillar) of the South African Furniture Industry Masterplan.

The KPIs for each pillar are organised in a dashboard view while each DSI occupies its own view. The dashboard is customizable and each KPI element can be resized and moved.
